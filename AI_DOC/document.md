# KnowledgeGraphGenius

## Introduction

KnowledgeGraphGenius is an open-source Python-based project designed to leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs to generate accurate and reliable information. The project addresses the common issue of hallucination in LLMs, where the model may generate false or misleading information.

## Project Overview

KnowledgeGraphGenius combines advanced natural language processing using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo, knowledge graph storage with Neo4j, and seamless interaction through Langchain. This project aims to ground information generated by LLMs, ensuring the provided content is factual and reliable.

## Features

1. **Information Grounding:** The project focuses on grounding LLM-generated content by extracting entities and relationships and storing them in a Neo4j knowledge graph.

2. **Langchain Integration:** Langchain provides a robust foundation for AI application development and facilitates seamless interaction between Python, LLMs, and Neo4j.

3. **RAG Model Usage:** The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model is employed to enhance content generation by first retrieving information from the knowledge graph.

## Prerequisites

To run KnowledgeGraphGenius, you need:

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key
- Neo4j database

## Setup

1. **Clone the KnowledgeGraphGenius repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/KnowledgeGraphGenius.git
   cd KnowledgeGraphGenius
